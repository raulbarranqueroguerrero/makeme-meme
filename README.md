#### Responsive design

## Make it Your Own!

#### 1. Make sure you have what you need
To build this website, you will need to have Node >=6 downloaded and installed on your machine. Find the latest version [HERE](https://nodejs.org/en/)

#### 2. Build a Create-React-App
Next, build the initial application using Create-React-App. This allows you to get up and running with a React app without the headache of setting up build-tool configurations. Go [HERE](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html) to get started. When the app building is finished run cd yourappname and run npm start to test it out. Hit ctrl+c in the terminal when you want to stop the server that the above command starts. For this project we will also need to install JQuery and ReactGA, do this by running npm install jquery --save and npm install react-ga --save in your terminal while inside your project folder. YOU MUST RUN THESE COMMANDS.

#### 3. Download the template
Once you have a React app up and running by following the steps in the above link, download my code by hitting the green "clone or download" button above and hit download zip. All you will have to do now is replace the "public" and "src" folders of your newly built app. If you run npm start now, you should see that your app renders the same as the one at the live demo link above.

#### 4. Make any styling changes you would like
Of course, all of the code is there and nothing is hidden from you so if you would like to make any other styling changes, feel free!

#### 5. Enjoy your new Meme Generator Web App
When you're all done, run npm start again and you'll see your new personal resume website! Congratulations!
